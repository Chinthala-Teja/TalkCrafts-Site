      <h2>What is TALK Crafts?</h2>
     
      <p>While interacting with my peers at college in my first year, I observed a common challenge: lack of confidence in public speaking and poor communication skills. These issues affected not only Professional Communication but also placement preparation and overall self-expression.</p>

      <p>To solve this, I initiated Talkcrafts â€” a student-led platform where interested students could practice mock presentations, public speaking, and interactive sessions to overcome stage fear and become better communicators. We followed a simple cycle :
<strong>Prepare â†’ Implement â†’ Improve â†’ Share</strong>, encouraging peer learning and confidence building.</p>

    <h2>About TalkUp â€“ AI Communication Coach</h2>
    <p>However, we soon realized that offline sessions had limitations in terms of reach, consistency, and personalization. That led me to scale the idea into a digital solution: TalkUp, an AI-powered communication training app..</p>
    <p><strong>TalkUp</strong> is a mobile/web platform that helps anyoneâ€”from students to YouTubersâ€”enhance their speaking skills through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Personalized Onboarding: Role & goal-based roadmap</li>
      <li>AI Coach: NLP-powered assistant with daily tasks & feedback</li>
      <li>Real-Time Video Practice: Simulate 1-on-1, debates, interviews</li>
      <li>AI Feedback: Fluency, grammar, tone, body language, eye contact</li>
      <li>Mock Interviews: With AI-generated avatars</li>
      <li>Learning Library: TED talks, videos, voice training, body tips</li>
      <li>Elite Coaching: Pro coaching sessions for Premium users</li>
      <li>Gamified Dashboard: Track progress with achievements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Why It Stands Out</h3>
    <p>Unlike other tools (Orai, Yoodli, Microsoft Coach), TalkUp combines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time AI + peer interaction</li>
      <li>Anonymous practice options</li>
      <li>Adaptive learning based on fears, goals</li>
      <li>Full-spectrum: verbal + non-verbal coaching</li>
    </ul>
